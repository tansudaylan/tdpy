# TDPY (TD's Python Library)

## Introduction
tdpy is a library with useful visualization routines and utility functions.

`tdpy.plot_grid()` offers several unique features such as

- one dimensional marginal distributions of each feature
- two dimensional marginal distributions of each pair of features
- lower triangular plot of the one and two dimensional marginal distributions
- annotations of anomalous samples with labels in the two dimensional marginal distribution plots,
- automated and smart positioning of annotations.


## Installation

You can install `tdpy` by running the `setup.py` script.
```
python setup.py install
